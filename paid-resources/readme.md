# Information

Most of our resources come with 2 purchase options; Open Source, and Escrow. We'll cover the difference in the two and walk you through the pros and cons for these resources.

## Escrow

***

To prevent leaks in the FiveM community, we need to escrow most, if not all, of our resources. This means locking them to a specific FiveM license and partially hiding some code. This helps stop our resources from being sold, reuploaded, or distributed without our permission.

### How does the encryption work ?

If this is your first time dealing with FiveM Encryption then don't worry here's the main key points of how the FiveM Encryption work.

* When purchasing one of our paid scripts that script is automatically linked to your FiveM account, that FiveM account is then linked to your server through CFX keys, you must be using this particular account and one of the three available keys to access your product.
* You can head over to [https://portal.cfx.re/](https://portal.cfx.re/) and under Assets it should be available just a few seconds after purchase.
* It is required that your server is using server artifacts version 4700+ update your artifacts here for [Windows ](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/)or here in [Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/).

## Open Source

***

Open source resources offer full access to code without limitations. As a result of this unrestricted availability, these resources typically come with a higher price tag.
