# Perspective

I've seen a lot of people looking for a camera/perspective system similar to the known servers out there; even some putting a price point on such a simple resource. The one's available publicly were just written terribly. Here is some information about this resource

## Main Features

***

* Optimized Resource (0.00ms idle, and 0.04 on use. No idle threads) utilizing ox's classes system.
* Multi-Framework support (This resource is standalone and does not require a framework).
* Fully translatable (english translation included).
* Zoom player camera with a simple keybind (First person, and running is not glitchy in the camera movements like the available resources out there).
* Freecam allowing players to take control of a camera to give themselves a different perspective in game. (Includes restrictions such as distance checks between the cam and player).
* Simple config for easy setup and use.

## Dependencies

***

* [Ox Lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases)
